            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I have served in the U.S. Army and seen combat in Operation Desert Shield / Desert Storm with the 24th Infantry Division from Fort Stewart Georgia. While in the military I was lucky enought to see different parts of the world to include western Europe, northern Africa and many parts of the U.S.</p>
            <p>After getting out of the Army I pursued a career in Financial Services as an Investment Advisor.  I enjoyed working with people and helping them with there retirement savings.</p>
            <p>While working in Financial Services I was part of a small firm when technology started to really get into the business. For that reason I started to get interested in setting up the servers and computers for the business. This led to my going back to school and receiving a  B.S. in Computer Information systems.</p>
